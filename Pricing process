#Business Process Understanding
Pricing as a domain impacts multiple departments. Marketing uses pricing as a tool to attract more customers. Customer department uses it to ensure better customer experience. Finance uses it to ensure bugetary targets are met. Pricing is also crucial to customers. Just by reducing prices you make your product affordable to customers who earlier were not able to consume your product.

In traditional economics, impact of pricing on a product is measured by its price elasticity curve. A price elasticity curve provides the relationship of demand for a product and its price. For a normal good demand increases as price decreases. Below is a typical price elasticity curve.

Firms need to have as much information as possible about how consumers will respond to price changes. For example, costs may rise as a result of an unforeseen change in import prices, or through a change in the exchange rate, and firms need to make a judgment about whether to raise (or lower) price.
