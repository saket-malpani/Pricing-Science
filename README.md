# Pricing-Science
Pricing science is used to set prices of products and estimating the impact of price change on product volume. While extensively studied in economics, pricing still remains a key area of research in retail setting due to lack of sufficient data for all products to accurately build a price elasticity model. Delineating the effect of price can also be challenging due to numerous other factors impacting trade eg: Weather, holiday, seasonality, promotions on other products leading to higher footfall and halo impact, price change of substitutes, competitor pricing strategies and so on. This work takes into consideration some of these factors and tries to provide a practical approach to pricing in a retail setting.
